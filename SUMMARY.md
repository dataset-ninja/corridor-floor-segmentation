**Corridor Floor Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the robotics industry. 

The dataset consists of 238 images with 238 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*floor*).

Images in the Corridor Floor Segmentation dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2023.
