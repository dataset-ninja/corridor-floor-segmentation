The  **Corridor Floor Segmentation** dataset is designed for the precise semantic segmentation of corridor floors with the aim of improved detection of walls and floor structures using a 2D camera-equipped mobile robot. This dataset features typical college corridor environments with numerous room entrances along the corridor, presenting a challenge for edge detection methods like Canny. The corridor floor surface exhibits a smooth texture with considerable light reflections, offering a diverse range of scenarios for analysis.
